# Note

[When using two equals signs for JavaScript equality testing, some funky conversions take place](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/)
>must check

## learn about: 
Parent Node: 
parentNode is the parent of the current node. The parent of an element is an Element node, a Document node, or a DocumentFragment node.

`Example
if (node.parentNode) {
  // remove a node from the tree, unless 
  // it's not in the tree already
  node.parentNode.removeChild(node);
}`

## Day-9
today done with :
 * **Next-Level Debugging with the Chrome Devtools & Breakpoints** 
 * **Testing Code Changes Directly in the Devtools**
 * **Debugging Code directly Inside VS Code**
 * **Understanding Hoisting**

## Day-10
today done with
 * How Code is Parsed & Compiled

## Day-11
today learn about:
* Memory life cycle 
* Circular references
* **MARK - AND - SWEEP  ALGORITHM**

      >   This algorithm reduces the definition of "an object is no longer needed" to "an object is unreachable"
 
* Memory management using anonymous function adding to eventListener as new objects is created at every click.
* memory leak increases as function is called at every click.
